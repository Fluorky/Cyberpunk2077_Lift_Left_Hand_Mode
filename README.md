# Cyberpunk2077_Lift_Left_Hand_Mode
These modified files allow you to use the left mouse button as the right button and vice versa. Tested on version Cyberpunk 2077 2.1, Windows 11 22H2 and Logitech Lift Left mouse (this mouse have hardware right button on left and left button on right, setting right button as primary in setting Windows, swaping mouse buttons through mouse properties or replacing left/right button in logitech options doesn't help in the Game. You cannot replace the right-left mouse buttons in the game settings because the game can't save the right button as the shoot button.")

To use this modification you must find and replace (before replacing please backup the files what you want to replace):
