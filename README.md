# Cyberpunk2077_Lift_Left_Hand_Mode
This modified files allow you to use the left mouse button as the right button and vice versa. Tested on version Cyberpunk 2077 2.1, windows 11 and logitech lift left (this mouse have hardware right button on left and left button on right, setting right button as primary in setting Windows, swaping mouse buttons through mouse properties or replacing left/right button in logitech options doesn't help)

To use this modification you must find and replace: 
<Cyberpunk Game Directory>/r6/config/nputUserMappings.xml
C:\Users\<your user name>\AppData\Local\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077\UserSettings.json
